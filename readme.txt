This plugin includes a new block inside each user profile page and includes a "Friend of a Friend (FOAF)" display.

== Description ==

**Increase communication and networking at your buddypress based social network.**

This plugin includes a new block inside each user profile page and includes a "Friend of a Friend (FOAF)" display.
If you have buddypress friends enabled your users will have friends. Their friends also have friends and these friends again have friends.
So there are "social paths" inside your members friends lists. This Plugin visualizes the nearest path to the user whose profile is visited by another user.
The world is small and you'll see that most users know each other - because their friends are friends...

**Features:**

* New block inside buddypress profile page (automatically integrated) that tells you whose friend the visited user is
* Shortcode: Create a page using the shortcode [buddypressfoaf_show_potential_friends] that shows excerps of friends of your friends that are not yet your friends
* Widget: Show a random user (friend's friend or random user if you do not have friends)

**More about me and my plugins**

Since the year 1999 I do administration, customizing and programming for several forums, communities and social networks. In the year 2013 I switched from another PHP framework to Wordpress.
Because not all plugins I'd like to have exist already I wrote some own plugins and I think I'll continue to do so.

If you have the scope at forums or social networks my other modules might also be interesting for you. [Just take a look at my Wordpress Profile to see all my Plugins.](http://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=quan_flo "ifs-net / quan_flo Wordpress Plugins") Use them and if my work helps you to save time, earn money or just makes you happy feel free to donate - Thanks. The donation link can be found at the right sidebar next to this text.
