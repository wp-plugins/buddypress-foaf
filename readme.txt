This plugin includes a new block inside each user profile page and includes a "Friend of a Friend (FOAF)" display.

== Description ==

Increase communication and networking at your buddypress based social network.
If you have buddypress friends enabled your users will have friends. Their friends also have friends and these friends again have friends.
So there are "social paths" inside your friend lists. This Plugin visualizes the nearest path to the user whose profile is visited by another user.

The world is small and you'll see that most users know each other - because their friends are friends or friends of their friends are friends ...

Just install, activate, it will automatically plug in into buddypress profile page
