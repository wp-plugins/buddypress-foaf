This plugin includes a new block inside each user profile page and includes a "Friend of a Friend (FOAF)" display.

== Description ==

Increase communication and networking at your buddypress based social network.
This plugin includes a new block inside each user profile page and includes a "Friend of a Friend (FOAF)" display.
If you have buddypress friends enabled your users will have friends. Their friends also have friends and these friends again have friends.
So there are "social paths" inside your friend lists. This Plugin visualizes the nearest path to the user whose profile is visited by another user.
The world is small and you'll see that most users know each other - because their friends are friends...

Features:

* Block inside buddypress profile page (automatically integrated) that tells you whose friend the visited user is
* Shortcode: Create a page using the shortcode [buddypressfoaf_show_potential_friends] that shows excerps of friends of your friends that are not yet your friends
* Widget: Show a random user (friend's friend or random user if you do not have friends)

Just install, activate, it will automatically plug in into buddypress profile page
